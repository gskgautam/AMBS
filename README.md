### File structure

`preprocessing.py`: Calculates the mean vector differences in a specific layer of the model between the positive(expected) and negative outcomes. Requires Alpaca, Beaver Tails, and TruthfulQA datasets.

`train.py`: Trains the steering vectors using the cosine similarity loss function.

`inference.py`: Generates the model output by adding the steering vectors at desired layer in the model. Allows for single head and multi-head(3) steering vector outputs

`win rate.py`: Calculates the win rate of the steered model outputs against da-vinci-003 outputs. Uses GPT-4o as the judge. Assumes that Q1 answers have already been segmented out by the user

`safety score.py`: Calculates the safety score of the steered outputs generated by the model. Assumes that Q2 answers have already been segmented out by the user

`ti score.py`: Calculates the truthfulness-informativeness of the steered model outputs using GPT-judge by EleutherAI. Assumes that Q3 answers have already been segmented out by the user
